# hello-world
This is my introduction to github.

My name is Rick Swinburne and I'm trying to learn about new ways to visualise my data. I love the way I can manipulate large amounts of data at such speed. Loving dplyr. Just starting Shiny and want to learn about hcharts but can't find any tutorials or anything, looks like a great package but I've no idea how to use it correctly.
